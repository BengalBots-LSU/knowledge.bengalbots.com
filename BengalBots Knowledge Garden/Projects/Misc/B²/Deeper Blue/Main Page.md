Deeper Blue is part of a larger project referred to as [[Projects/Misc/B²/Main Page|B².]] It is also a revival of an old project that was known as "Deep Blue." 

Designed as a ~3 lb battlebot, it is one of the designs created B². Internally the electronics and mechanical assembly & manufacturing is rather straightforward.

## Mechanical

The frame (the stuff that needs to be manufactured) consists of four main components. The main chassis, motor mount clamps, a lid that doubles as a battery mount, and a front mounting space for a plow or other weapon variants.
