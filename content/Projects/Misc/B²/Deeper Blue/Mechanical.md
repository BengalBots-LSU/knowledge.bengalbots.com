[Here are all the fusion files!](https://mylsu1602.autodesk360.com/g/projects/20240917805728881/data/dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5mb2xkZXI6Y28ua1ZBUHBtUU1URjJvTktVXzNSM0ZuQQ)

The bot is built around a 3d printed chassis (165mm x 165mm). For V1, we opted to use PLA. After some hours in the Louisiana heat, we've decided that using PETG is wiser going forward.

For the wheels, V1 used [these BaneBots wheels](https://banebots.com/banebots-wheel-3-7-8-x-0-8-hub-mount-50a-blue/). No significant rational went into choosing the wheels other than the fact we had them on hand.

A 3d printed adapter is used to adapt the [FingerTech Silver Spark](https://www.fingertechrobotics.com/proddetail.php?prod=ft-Sspark16) motor to the wheels.

Most notable in this design is the front plate. This is just a placeholder to work as a slot for any module weapons.
For example, we've designed a plow weapon that is supposed to be able to simply slot into place.
