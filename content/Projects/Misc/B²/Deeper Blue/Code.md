All of the code for this project is hosted at [this repository](https://github.com/BengalBots-LSU/Deeper-Blue.) 
The repository is divided into two branches. One of them is just a `.ino` file that you can throw into the Arduino IDE and load up. The other one is integrated through Platform IO and is based on `C++`.
