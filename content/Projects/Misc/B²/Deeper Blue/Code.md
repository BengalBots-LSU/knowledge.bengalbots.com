All of the code for this project is hosted at [this repository](https://github.com/BengalBots-LSU/Deeper-Blue). 
The repository is divided into two branches. One of them is just a `.ino` file that you can throw into the Arduino IDE and load up. The other one is integrated through Platform IO and is based on `C++`.

#### Imports

You'll want to download and import the [`Ps4 Controller Host Library`](https://github.com/pablomarquez76/PS4_Controller_Host) . You may be able to go ahead and simple do

```cpp
#include <PS4Controller.h>
```
