B² currently only exists as a concept. Named after LSU's own B³, Bengal Bot Brawl, it is a smaller version of a battlebot competition meant to serve as a fundraising event for BengalBots.

Rather than contestants design and manufacture their own bots, BengalBots creates them and charges a fee for contestants to be able to use them and compete.
