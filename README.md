# BengalBots Digital Garden

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

## To Commit:

1. Git Clone this repository
2. Open the "content" folder as an Obsidian Vault
3. Git Commit & Push any updates you have. [I](https://github.com/AZapie) recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) if you just want to upload changes to keep things simple.
  - There is a Git plugin for Obsidian that you can configure to automatically pull from origin & push changes. I'll try to write a tutorial for that eventually.
